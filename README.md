# programautomatycyRestAssured

My first steps with RestAssured in Java, guided by programautomatycy.pl with my own additionals.

**Used libraries:** 
Rest Assured <br>
JUnit <br>
Json <br>
Jackson <br>

**Used tools:**
IntelliJ <br> 
Postman <br>
Swagger <br>
Maven <br>
Rest Assured <br>

The project contains 10 tasks that I solved independently, using my previous knowledge - 
so the solutions are often different from those proposed by the author of the course.
